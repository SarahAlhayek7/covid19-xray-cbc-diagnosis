# COVID-19 Diagnosis Using X-ray & CBC Data

## Project Overview

This graduation project presents an AI-based system for **COVID-19 diagnosis** by integrating **Chest X-ray images** and **Complete Blood Count (CBC) data**. The goal is to support medical decision-making using a lightweight, end-to-end intelligent solution.

---

## Key Features

* Chest X-ray classification using a **DenseNet** deep learning model.
* CBC analysis using multiple machine learning models, with **XGBoost** selected as the final model.
* **Average-based fusion** of X-ray and CBC predictions using an AI agent.
* Support for multi-class classification.
* Simple deployment to demonstrate system functionality.
